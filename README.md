### About 🧩

Backend software engineer with professional experience at **Mercado Libre** and **Rappi**, focused primarily on **Go (Golang)**. I also work comfortably with **Java (Spring Boot)** and **Node.js/React** when needed.

I enjoy designing and operating **complex/distributed systems**, as well as building **developer tools**, **CLIs**, and small high-impact products. Outside work, you’ll find me reading about **history** or out **hiking/trekking**.

- **Distributed systems**: performance, resilience, scalability, operability  
- **Developer experience**: CLIs, internal tooling, templates, automation  
- **Engineering practices**: testing, reviews, CI/CD, documentation, postmortems

**Frontend:** React  
**Platform/Practices:** REST · gRPC · Docker · CI/CD · Observability (logs/metrics/traces)
